Cooking at Our House

Cooking at Our House is a project to move a printed cookbook onto the Internet,
hosting it on a server in the cloud.

This project contains the initial code, which uses dummy data. Instead of 
reading from a database or repository, the recipe and category information 
is hardcoded in the Javascript.
