                <h2>There is a Third Edition?!?</h2>
                <p>I never intended to make a third edition. But there were still some errors in the 
                    second edition, and people (especially Donna) shared family recipes with me. And 
                    Steve and I developed some new favorite recipes. Yes! Steve has started using recipes, 
                    at least a little. Now that he is retired, finding new things to cook has become a 
                    serious pastime for him.</p>
                <p>Finally, my copy of the second edition cookbook was just plain worn out. I guess 
                    I will keep doing this every decade or so, until maybe I put all of this on the 
                    Internet. If I removed any recipe that you love, let me know and I will put it back in. 
                    But I wanted to keep this book around 300 recipes for practical reasons.</p>
                <p>I tried to keep the same chapter headings, and the same general order. But I had to 
                    break the desserts, pies, and cakes section in two â€“ there were just too many!</p>
