directions : <TEXT><p>Crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the shortening, mixing till well combined. Cut the butter into small cubes or pats, and work it into the dry ingredients (using your fingers, a pastry blender or fork, or a mixer) until the dough is unevenly crumbly.</p>
<p>Sprinkle in the ice water, continuing to mix until the dough is cohesive. Grab a handful; if it holds together willingly, and doesn't seem at all dry or crumbly, you've added enough liquid.</p>
<p>Divide the dough roughly in half, with one half slightly larger than the other. If you have a scale, the pieces will weigh about 11 ounces and 9 ounces. Shape each piece of dough into a disk. Roll the edges along a floured work surface (as though the disk were a wheel), in order to smooth them out.  Pat each disk till it's about 1" thick, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. You may also chill the dough overnight, or for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>Remove the dough from the refrigerator. If it's been chilled longer than 30 minutes, allow it to warm a bit and become flexible, about 15 to 30 minutes. While the dough is warming, prepare the filling, and preheat the oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>Filling: Place the sliced apples in a medium mixing bowl, and stir in the sugar, boiled cider, spices, salt, vanilla, and lemon juice. As you stir, the mixture will become syrupy. Add the butter and flour, and stir until everything is well blended. Set it aside.</p>
<p>Flour your work surface, and roll the larger piece of the dough into a 14" circle. Transfer the dough to a 9" regular (not deep-dish) pie pan that's at least 1 1/4" deep. Spoon the filling into the crust.</p>
<p>Roll the top crust about into an 11" circle, and place it over the filling.  Fold the edge of the bottom crust up over the edge of the top crust, squeeze them together, and crimp nicely. Cut a decorative slit (or a quarter-sized hole) in the center of the crust, for steam to escape.</p>
<p>Place the pie pan on a cookie sheet (to catch any spills), and bake the pie for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Gently place a sheet of aluminum foil atop the pie, covering its entire surface, and continue to bake for an additional 1 hour, 15 minutes, for a total of 2 hours, till the top crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>
<p>Remove the pie from the oven, and allow it to cool overnight, for best texture. If you cut into it too soon, the filling will be watery, and will ooze out.</p>
<p>To serve warm, heat individual slices briefly in the microwave. Serve with vanilla ice cream, if desired.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Jackson's vanilla wafers are the very best for banana pudding, but I don't think you can find them outside of Arkansas. Some people do not want meringue on their pudding, but prefer to chill it and top it with whipped cream instead. Real aficionados probably don't want either meringue or whipped cream. Imitation banana flavoring - oh no! Well, it adds a kick that this dish needs, so I use it although I generally avoid imitation stuff. I suppose you could try banana liqueur.</p>

These ribs are tender and flavorful.  If you must, you can grill the ribs for the last 30 minutes of cooking, over medium-low coals.  Baste the ribs with the sauce often. Or smoke the ribs until almost done (instead of baking them for the first 90 minutes), then finish them with the sauce in the oven.</p>

Make sure that you get pieces with lots of bones (necks, wings, backs) and leave the skin on for the best taste. I think that this stock is so much better than anything you can buy -- you really can taste the difference.  Plus, it has no salt. I use large mouth quart canning jars to store the stock. When I make a bunch of stock, I'll sometimes freeze it. You probably shouldn't keep it in the refrigerator for more than a couple of weeks. </p>

<p>Butter or oil:  You may use olive oil in place of the butter if desired.  Some recipes actually use an entire stick of butter, and 3 to 4 tablespoons is not uncommon.  Extra butter improves the flavor and texture, but it is not necessary.</p>

Of course, we have modified the recipe slightly: the original called for 1 can of plain black-eyed peas and one can of black-eyed peas with jalapeños. It also called for 2 cans of stewed tomatoes or Rotel; using only stewed tomatoes would obviously make the recipe milder. I like to add ham to this recipe, especially since I often cook this for New Year's Day and I often have leftover ham with a bone.</p>
<p>Steve sometimes adds a pound of browned ground beef to the recipe, instead of the ham. Personally, I don't see the need for that, but if you do, you will probably need to adjust the seasonings a bit.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This recipe is very tasty, and makes a huge amount of stock.  You can serve the ribs with the stock, but you have other choices. One: you can remove the ribs and vegetables with a slotted spoon and make gravy with the stock. Two: You can remove the ribs, and then use a blender to puree the vegetables to make a thicker stock/gravy.</p>
<p>Be sure to serve this with something to soak up the stock: mashed potatoes and bread are good.</p>
<p>By the way, this recipe says "4 servings" not "will serve 4 people." This is a bit more than 2 people can eat (or at least more than they should), but it will not serve 4 adults.</p>

directions : <TEXT><p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a heavy 12-inch ovenproof saucepan or Dutch oven. Add the cornmeal, stock, oil and salt. Stir with a fork or whisk until well-blended. The mixture will separate, but don’t worry - it won’t come together for more than half the cooking time. Bake uncovered for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the polenta is creamy and tender. Stir with a long-pronged fork; adjust the seasoning and bake for 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Stir in additional butter or grated cheese if desired. Pour onto a wooden pizza peel or into a buttered bowl.</p>
<p>To adjust the thickness, vary the amount of liquid, not the cooking time:</p>
<p>Very soft - use 12 cups liquid</p>
<p>Soft - use 10 cups</p>
<p>Medium - use 8 cups</p>
<p>Very firm - use 6 cups</p>
<p>For most purposes, use soft polenta, but for polenta that is to be sautéed or broiled, make very firm polenta.  Spread it on a platter and let it cool, then cut and sauté or broil.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I could never make a decent chocolate pie until I used this recipe. This is a chocolate meringue pie like my father's mother used  to make.  Sometimes I make this pie for absolutely no occasion - I just want to eat some. I don't think that Marie Callendar or any of the pie shops make a chocolate pie that comes close to this, especially if you use high-quality ingredients. I got this recipe from Donna years ago.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>The eggs and butter should be at room temperature before you begin.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk cocoa and boiling water until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°Fabout 20 minutes before baking.</p>
<p>Prepare one 9-inch round cake pan (2” deep): coat the bottom with shortening. Insert a round of parchment paper to fit the bottom. Spray with a baking spray that contains flour.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, 3 tablespoons of water, and the vanilla until lightly combined.</p>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt on low speed for about 30 seconds. Add the butter, oil and cocoa mixture. Mix on low speed until dry ingredients are moistened. Raise the speed to medium and beat for 1 ½ minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</p>
<p>Starting on medium-low speed, gradually add the egg mixture in two parts. Beat on medium speed for 30 seconds after each part, to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface evenly.</p>
<p>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. The cake should spring back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should not shrink from the sides of the pan until after it is removed from the oven.</p>
<p>Let the cake cook on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a small metal spatula between the sides of the the pan and the cake. Invert the cake onto a lightly greased wire rack, then re-invert it to prevent splitting. Cook completely.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This sauce is very similar in taste to Hershey's syrup, although the texture is a little different. I can only make this at the holidays when there are a lot of people around.  Otherwise, I will eat ice cream twice a day just to have this syrup.

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is amazingly good.  It reminds me of coleslaw, but also it is a fancy chopped salad. You really should make this the day before, but if all the ingredients are very cold, you can serve it the same day.</p>
<p>The only bad news is that you simply can't save the leftovers; it's terrible the next day because it just gets too soggy. But if you don't dress the whole salad, you can save it. So I often only use half the salad and half the dressing on the first day.  If we don't need the rest, I will save the remaining salad and dressing (separately) and do it again in the next day or so.</p></TEXT>

categories : [ "yeastbreads" ]
directions : <TEXT><p>In a mixing bowl, cream together the sugar, salt, shortening and powered milk. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment. Whip in the egg and lemon zest (or Fiori di Sicilia or lemon extract) until smooth. Add the flour, yeast and water (or milk). Mix on low speed until the dough forms a ball.</p>
<p>In the stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on low for 2 minutes, then let the dough rest in the bowl for 10 minutes. Then, run the mixer on medium for approximately 10 minutes, until the dough is silky and supple, tacky but not sticky. If you prefer hand kneading: turn the dough out and knead it about 2 minutes, forming a ball. Let the ball rest for 10 minutes, then knead by hand for 12 to 15 minutes more. You may need to add a little flour or water to the dough while kneading.</p>
<p>Very lightly coat a bowl with oil then place the dough into; turn the dough to coat it. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for about 2 hours until it is doubled. While the dough rises, mix the cinnamon sugar in a small jar or bowl. Prepare a sheet pan or baking sheet by lining it with baking parchment.</p>
<p>Mist the counter with spray oil and turn out the dough. With your hands and then a rolling pin, shape the dough into a square approximately 14" wide and 12"  deep. If you roll the dough out too thin, the cinnamon rolls will be tough.Cover the top of the dough with cinnamon sugar, from edge to edge.  Be generous and use it all. Roll up the dough toward you so that the resulting log is about 14" long. Pinch the seam closed and then turn it to the bottom. Cut the dough into 12 pieces and carefully place them in the pan. Place the buns about ½ inch apart.</p>
<p>To bake another day: Lightly spray the buns with cooking oil, then cover the pan with plastic wrap. Seal the edges, but leave some room for the dough to expand. Place the pan in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Four hours before you want to cook, remove the pan from the refrigerator.</p>
<p>To bake today: Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 75 to 90 minutes, until the buns have grown into each other and nearly doubled in size.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes before you want to cook, preheat the oven to 350 F. Bake the buns for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Cool in the pans for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>While the buns cool, make the fondant: sift the powdered sugar into a bowl. Add the flavoring (vanilla, lemon extract, or nothing) and the milk, briskly whisking until all the sugar is dissolved. You may not need all of the milk, or you made need a tablespoon or two more. Make a thick, smooth paste.</p>
<p>Streak the glaze over the buns while they are warm, but not too hot. Once the glaze no longer runs, you can place the buns on a cooling rack. Wait at least 10 more minutes before serving for the best texture.</p></TEXT>

title : <TEXT>Cinnamon Rolls</TEXT>
notes : <TEXT><div id="notes"><p>For the dough, if you have it, use ¼ to ½ teaspoon of  Fiori di Sicilia instead of the lemon zest. You can also use lemon extract or lemon oil instead of the zest, but I think the lemon flavor is too strong; cut it back to about ½ tsp at most. And while the fondant also calls for lemon, I prefer to use vanilla extract if the lemon scent of the dough is strong. The hint of lemon and vanilla should be there, but it should not compete with the cinnamon. Use the best, freshest cinnamon you can get; it makes a difference. You can use butter instead of shortening if you prefer, but I think that shortening makes the better dough. And finally, if you don't want to use powdered milk, use a cup of milk instead of the water.</p>

directions : <TEXT><p>Mix milk powder, sugar, salt, cacao powder, and tapioca starch in a 2.5 quart saucepan. Add the cream and milk; whisk well until all dry ingredients have been incorporated. Whisk in corn syrup and egg yolks.</p>
<p>Put the chopped chocolate in a a glass or heatproof bowl that is large enough to contain the entire mixture. Set aside.</p>
<p>Begin cooking the base over medium-high heat, using a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl. Whisk continuously to prevent any burning or clumping. Whisk slowly in the beginning; increase speed as mixture becomes warmer and begins to steam and thicken.</p>
<p>The mixture should thicken without boiling after 8 to 10 minutes; watch carefully so it doesn’t burn. Once the mixture coats the back of a spoon, continue to cook for 15 seconds longer, whisking vigorously; then immediately remove from heat.</p>
<p>Pour half of the hot mixture over the chopped chocolate, and whisk to allow the chocolate to melt and incorporate. Then whisk in the rest of the hot mixture, making sure all of the chocolate is fully melted and mixed in. (This can be a challenge to get the last bits of chocolate melted, but if you don’t they will be small bitter bits in the final product!)</p>
<p>Lay plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Allow the mixture to sit about 45 minutes, until no longer hot. Place in the refrigerator to cool completely, about 4 hours.</p>
<p>Pour cold and thickened mixture into gelato machine or ice cream maker. Churn according to manufacturer’s directions. The gelato will expand and should churn until it is thick and creamy, but still soft enough to scoop into a storage container, about 30 - 55 minutes.</p>
<p>Place a piece of plastic directly on the gelato in the storage container. Top with an airtight lid and place in the refrigerator. Let the gelato freeze for at least 4-6 hours. It should be firm enough to scoop, but soft and creamy in texture.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I love this recipe. It makes a fairly dark chocolate gelato. You can vary its intensity by using different chocolate: I’ve been known to use all 63% chocolate, because that it is what I had, and it was great. It is a pain to chop the chocolate, but it needs to be pretty fine so that it will melt into the ice cream correctly. A food processor can help make sure it is well-chopped, just be careful not to melt it down too much. I use Guittard chocolate, but use any high quality chocolate that you like.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Prepare the crust</p>
<p>Combine and sift dry ingredients to mix thoroughly.  Cut in shortening until it is pea-sized; this crust has a lot of fat.  Add ice water by tablespoons, tossing the dough with a fork until it starts to hold together.  Press the dough into a rough disk and chill for at least 30 minutes.  Preheat oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>Roll out the crust and place in a 9-inch pie pan.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, until lightly browned.</p>
<p>Set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Prepare the filling</p>
<p>In a medium saucepan, combine the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. Gradually stir in the coconut milk and the whole milk, making sure to avoid lumps. Place over medium heat and stir constantly until thick, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan and avoid scorching. Reduce heat if needed; mixture should not boil.  This step will take around 20 minutes. The mixture should thickly coat a spoon when done.</p>
<p>Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl. Gradually add spoonfuls of the hot mixture while whisking constantly, until egg yolks are quite warm. Whisk the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan. Stir in the shredded coconut. Cook for 2 more minutes.</p>
<p>Remove from heat; add extracts and butter. Beat until well mixed, then pour into cooled pie shell.</p>
<p>Top with meringue</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375°F.</p>
<p>In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg whites with mixer until frothy.  While continuing to beat on high speed, sprinkle in the sugar by teaspoons.  Beat for several seconds after each addition.  Stop when all sugar is dissolved and soft peaks form.</p>
<p>Mound meringue over the hot pie filling, sealing to edge of crust.  Sprinkle shredded coconut over the top.  Bake about 10 minutes, until meringue is lightly browned and coconut is toasted.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I make this pie because Steve likes coconut better than chocolate or lemon. It took a couple of attempts to get this recipe just right. For the shredded coconut, I use the best and freshest unsweetened coconut I can find, but you could use sweetened coconut if you prefer. You could also use coconut cream instead of coconut milk: you will find coconut cream with the cocktail mixes in the grocery store. Finally, I use the whole can of coconut milk, and then add regular milk to make 3 cups.</p></TEXT>

You can use any cheese you want, but most cheese will be grainy. Use Velveeta if it doesn't offend your sensibilities too much; it melts evenly and will make a smooth soup.</p>

<p>To make Chicken and Dumplings, I just boil some chicken and pick the meat from the bone in chunks; toss the water. Cut up as much celery and onion as you like, relative to the amount of chicken you have. Sauté the celery and onion in a little oil until soft. Add the chicken. Add enough stock to cover the ingredients, plus about an inch more. (Use good stock, not the water the chicken was boiled in.) Season to taste with salt, pepper, marjoram, thyme or whatever you like.

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is the pancake recipe I've used since the 1970s. It works every time and it makes nice, light pancakes. The only problem I've ever encountered is with over-active baking powder. A few brands of double-acting baking powder may cause the batter to balloon up so much that it can't be ladled onto the griddle.  If this happens, stir the batter lightly to release the excess air bubbles. And next time, cut the baking powder down - a tablespoon may be sufficient. </p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Sort figs; use ripe figs but not cracked ones. Peel the figs with a sharp knife.  (If you do not peel figs, clean the skins: cover the figs with hot water and bring it to a boil.  Remove from heat and let stand 3-4 minutes.  Drain.) Stir together the sugar and water in a large heavy pot. Stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat and bring to a boil for 4 minutes. Add lemon and figs. Cook over medium heat, at a gentle and steady boil, until clear and translucent -- about 1½ hours. Do not stir; do not scrap the bottom; do not shake the pot. Fill hot, sterilized jars with boiling figs and syrup to within ½ inch of the top. Use a small spatula (or other nonmetallic utensil) to release any air bubbles. Wipe sealing edge and seal. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Canning notes: I suggest that you use pint jars for this.  You can reuse old jars, but not old lids. Place 8 jars in a pot that is at least 3 inches deeper than the jars. Fill the jars and the pot with cool water to the top of the jars.  Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat, but do not boil. Place 8 new flat lids in a small saucepan and cover with water.   Cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat, but do not boil.  Do not heat the screw bands. Fill one jar at a time.  Remove jar from canner with tongs; pour the water from the jar back into the canner.  Do not dry the jar.  Place the jar on a tray.  Fill the jar as directed above. Screw on the band, using only your fingers, until resistance is met.  Then tighten down using only your fingertips.  Do not use any tools, or over-tighten the band.  Return jar to canning pot. When all jars are filled, cover pot and bring to a full rolling boil.  Do not start the timer until water is boiling rapidly. At the end of the processing time, remove lid, turn off heat and wait 5 minutes.  Remove jars without tilting them.  Place jars on a towel in a draft-free place and let rest undisturbed for 24 hours. After 24 hours, check lids for seal: remove screw bands and press down on the center of each lid with your finger.  Sealed lids will be concave (they will curve downward) and will not move when pressed with your finger.  Jars that did not seal must be refrigerated immediately.  If desired, put screw bands back on the jars, loosely.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I believe that I have finally located a recipe on the internet that will reproduce my Grandma Monk's fig preserves. To be honest, I haven't tried it yet. I once asked her how she made her preserves and she said "Make a simple syrup with sugar, add the figs and lemon. Then can it."  That's not a quote, but it's close.  So I know that this recipe has the right ingredients.  She might have used a little more lemon, though. And I have seen other recipes that use only 6 cups of sugar. I am sure that she did not peel her figs.  Use ripe figs from Arkansas or Louisiana; they are yellow-green and available in July and August.  I don't know the name of the variety. Her figs were light brown in the jar and unbroken; the insides of the figs were the same color as the outside.</p>
<p>This recipe promises to deliver the whole fruit in a syrup about the consistency of honey.  That sounds like her preserves!</p>
<p>The yield is just an estimate. If you don't have enough jars, place any leftover preserves in an airtight container and refrigerate it.  Use them within a few weeks.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Pastry in general, and pie crusts in particular, are my downfall as a cook. This recipe works better than most I've tried, though. I have been told that a pie crust can be either tender or flaky but not both. But I recently learned that a pie crust will be more tender if you add a tablespoon of sugar to the flour and salt.  You can also replace up to 2 tablespoons of the flour with cornstarch. And since I have made pie crusts could not be cut with a fork, this is all good news.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Basic Gingerbread:</p>
<p>In a large bowl, sift together flour and ginger; make a well in center. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine butter, molasses and brown sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until thoroughly melted, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in baking soda until blended. Add liquids and eggs to the well in the flour. Stir until thoroughly blended. On a lightly floured surface, knead mixture to form a smooth dough, about 1 minute. Divide dough into thirds. Wrap each piece separately and refrigerate until slightly firm, a minimum of 30 minutes. Dough can be refrigerated for up to 48 hours. Continue with the "Baking the House" section below.</p>
<p>Old-Fashioned Gingerbread:</p>
<p>In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine shortening, sugar, molasses and eggs. Beat on medium speed until smooth and blended, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-low; add flour mixture and beat until blended, another 3 to 4 minutes. Divide dough in thirds. Wrap each piece separately and refrigerate until slightly firm, a minimum of 30 minutes. Dough can be refrigerated for up to 48 hours. Continue with the "Baking the House" section below.</p>
<p>Baking the House:</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°Ffor at least 30 minutes. To create one gingerbread house, bake the side walls once and the front-back walls/room section twice, using 1/3 of dough each time. With a pastry brush, thoroughly grease the plaque before baking. Beginning in the center of each mold and working out to the corners, press the dough with your fingers. Press thoroughly into the relief to prevent air pockets from forming. Bake until gingerbread is cooked through and pulls away from the edges, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in plaque - be patient! Turn gingerbread out of plaque and carefully invert, relief side down, onto a wire rack to cool at least 1 hour. Repeat with remaining dough -- let plaque cool completely before the next round.</p>
<p>Royal Icing:</p>
<p>This is the cement that holds the house together. Do not make it before you are ready to begin house construction. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all ingredients. Beat on medium-high until mixture forms still peaks and is nearly triple in volume. This will take 7-8 minutes. (Use a stand mixer if you have one, because this is a long time to hold a mixer.) Cover tightly with plastic wrap to prevent drying and store at room temperature.</p>
<p>Building the House:</p>
<p>All pieces of the house should be completely cool. It is best if the pieces rest a day, because they do sometimes shrink or warp a little. Prepare the Royal Icing. With a sharp knife, lightly "shave" the sides of each wall to create smooth, flush edges. Fit a pastry bag with a small tip, and fill it with icing. Apply a thin ribbon of icing (about 1/8 inch thick) along the edge of a side wall. With the pattern facing out, join the side wall to the front/back wall to form a right angle and a flush corner. Hold firmly until the icing hardens and the walls bond -- about 1 to 2 minutes. Let this piece sit for 7 to 8 minutes more.  While waiting, repeat with the other two pieces. You will have two L-shaped pieces. Apply a ribbon of icing to the remaining edges and carefully join the 2 L-shaped pieces. Hold firmly until the icing hardens, 1 to 2 minutes. Reinforce the inside corners with additional icing. Let set 7 to 8 minutes Add the roof: apply a thin ribbon of icing around the top edges of each wall. One piece at a time, place the roof sections, curved side down, on top of the house and hold firmly until they bond and the icing hardens, about 2 minutes. Let sit for 7-8 minutes. Build the chimney: Apply a dot of icing to both sides of the non-relief chimney piece. Join the remaining two chimney pieces, relief-sides facing out, to either side of the iced piece and hold firmly until they bond, 1 to 2 minutes. To attach the chimney to the root, apply 2-3 dots of icing to the underside and place on top of the roof next to the side with chimney design. Allow the house to set at leave 30 minutes before decorating. You may wish to pipe additional icing along the exposed seams for decoration and additional strength. Wait 30 minutes before doing this as you are adding weight to the structure. I recommend that you wait at least 24 hours before decorating if you have added more icing.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Yes, this is the gingerbread for making houses. It is very time-consuming and I haven’t done it in a long time.</p>
<p>Be sure to start this the WEEK before you want to decorate. The gingerbread needs to sit up for a day before you construct the house, and then the house needs to sit for at least a day before you decorate.  So it's best to have a weekend for construction and then a weekend for decoration. Do not short-cut the steps or the hardening time, or things will fall apart.</p>
<p>I have a mold, and I don't know how you would do this without one! Use either the Basic Gingerbread or the Old Fashion Gingerbread recipe to make the walls.  Since you probably aren't going to eat this fresh, or even at all, who cares?</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is a great recipe for gluten-free rolls; it is as quicker and easier than most regular roll recipes. It does require a few special ingredients, but these are things you will want to keep on hand if you are baking gluten-free. I use King Arthur Flour's brand of gluten-free flour and find it excellent if a bit expensive. Xanthan gum is a powder that can be purchased from King Arthur, but can be found in many other places.</p>
<p>Yes, you can buy many gluten-free breads now, but I think there is something special about cooking your own. Especially at the holidays, when folks with allergies are often denied the family's favorite foods, this is a small effort that can make them feel included and appreciated.</p>
<p>Gluten-free breads do not keep well; this is another reason that it can be better to bake than to buy. </p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is Steve's version of guacamole. It's simple and it doesn't try to stretch the avocado with a bunch of filler. Therefore, it doesn't disguise the taste of the avocado. We like it with lots of pepper, so you might want to start with half as much pepper and see how it tastes to you.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Mix together all ingredients, except the coating, in a food processor. Shape the mixture into a ball, and roll in your choice of coating. This is a very sticky mixture, and can be challenging to shape!</p>
<p>My shaping technique: place some of the almonds on a small piece of parchment paper. Carefully scrape the mixture on top of the almonds, trying to shape it into a ball as much as possible. Chilling the mixture for an hour at this point may help. Pat the almonds onto the top and sides of the ball. Find a bowl that will hold at least half of the mixture; I use a cereal bowl. As best you can, line the bowl with almonds. Carefully turn the ham ball into the bowl and use the bowl to shape it. Pat with almonds and rotate until you have used up all the almonds. Place the bowl in the refrigerator; turn out onto a pretty dish to serve.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>For the InstantPot:</p>
<p>Place a rack in the pot; I like to use a silicone basket that is easy to remove when done.  Pour in the water and place eggs in the rack. Close and lock the lid; make sure the pressure valve is set to Sealing. Press Manual or Pressure Cook (depending on the model). Select High Pressure. Set the time to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>When the cooking cycle ends, set a time for 5 more minutes. Then vent the pressure.</p>
<p>Press Cancel and remove the lid. Transfer the eggs to a medium bowl of cold water with ice. Allow the eggs to cool 5 minutes in the water. Adjust time if you want a softer yolk.</p>
<p>Manual method:</p>
<p>Bring eggs to room temperature. (Variations in starting temperature affect how the eggs cook.)</p>
<p>Pierce the large end of each egg with a pin to let air escape.</p>
<p>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs - but don’t add eggs yet. Bring the water to a boil and then add eggs.</p>
<p>Simmer approximately 8 minutes for soft-boiled, or 12 minutes for hard-boiled.</p>

directions : <TEXT><p>Combine sugar, butter, egg yolk, salt and flavor; beat until smooth.</p>
<p>Add the flour, mixing until smooth. The mixture will seem dry at first, but will suddenly come together. If it doesn't, dribble in up to a tablespoon of water.</p>
<p>Divide the dough in half. Shape each half into a flattened disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight.</p>
<p>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F and remove disks from refrigerator. Let disks warm up for 20 to 30 minutes until soft enough to roll. The dough will be cold, but not rock hard.</p>
<p>Sprinkle work surface and rolling pin with flour. Roll out a disk to ⅛" to 3/16" thick. Cut shapes with cookie cutter. Place close together on ungreased cookie sheet - these cookies spread very little. (Tip: use parchment paper to remove cookies easily between batches.)</p>
<p>Bake cookies for 12 to 14 minutes, until set and barely brown at the edges. Cool cookies on the pan (or slide parchment off onto rack). Do not try to move cookies until they have set and cooled slightly. When cookies are completely cool, ice and decorate.</p>
<p>Icing: combine sugar, milk and corn syrup to make a soft, smooth, spreadable icing. The icing should go on thick, but settle into a smooth surface in about 30 minutes. Test it and adjust as needed. It is easier to add more milk than it is to add more sugar. But don't wait until the icing hardens to decorate the cookies!</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is a replacement for the rolled sugar cookie recipe that I used to use for making Christmas cookies. I like to make the cookies and then decorate them with friends and family. The first dozen cookies are usually carefully decorated with traditional motifs - blue eyes and red mouths on the gingerbread men, for example. But by the last dozen, strange-looking cookies are produced as we get bored and start trying to use up all the frosting. I have a multi-decade collection of metal cookie cutters.</p>
<p>These cookies are a bit brittle if rolled thin, but they are very tasty. They cut into cookies easily and are good to decorate, too. In addition to decorating after cooking, try sprinkling some colored sugar on the cookies before you bake them.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>You can use white pepper instead of cayenne if you prefer. Black pepper makes the sauce look very unappealing. You can use margarine instead of butter for this sauce, but if you are really concerned about cholesterol, you shouldn't be making this sauce anyway!</p>
<p>You must serve this sauce immediately after it is made. It will curdle if left on the stove, and it will develop a skin if it cools down too much. I think the trick to Hollandaise is patience; you are emulsifying the butter and the egg yolk, and the slower you melt the butter, the better.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Save the leafy tops from the celery when you chop it.</p>
<p>Hit Sauté” n the Instant Pot; adjust if needed so it’s on the “More” setting. Add in the butter. Once melted, add in the onion, carrots, and celery; sauté for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute longer.</p>
<p>Pour in the stock and stir well. Add the chicken and make sure it is covered by the stock. Toss the in the bay leaves and secure the lid. Hit “Cancel” and then hit “Pressure Cook.”  Set it for High Pressure for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>When the chicken is done cooking, perform a quick release. Discard the bay leaves and remove the chicken from pot with tongs. Set chicken aside in a bowl to cool. Add the sherry, seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, pepper, rubbed sage, thyme parsley, and the leafy celery tops to the InstantPot; stir well. Let the pot rest for the time being</p>
<p>While the chicken cools, make the dumplings: Put the flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together.  In a pyrex dish, combine the butter and milk; microwave for 40 seconds. Pour the milk/butter mixture into the flour and lightly mix with a fork until totally blended so a warm dough forms. (NOTE: Don’t overdo the mixing as it can make for a tough dumpling). Lightly knead the dough. Then, on a clean surface covered with flour, take a flour-coated rolling pin and roll the dough to be 1/8″ thick max. (It is very important to keep the dumplings thin so they will cook properly).Using a pizza cutter or a knife, slice the dough vertically into strips about 1” wide and then slice horizontally about 2” wide, forming little rectangular strips. Dust with additional flour so the strips don’t stick to each other.</p>
<p>Turn the InstantPot back on: hit “Sauté” and make sure it is on “High” setting. Once the stock bubbles, stir in the cornstarch slurry. When it returns to a boil, add the dumpling strips one-by-one and then give them a good stir making sure none are sticking to each other. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.  (NOTE: Use a glass lid if you have it. If you use the pressure-cooking lid, do not let it seal. Rest it slightly off-kilter on the pot as it may come to pressure otherwise – even with the valve in “venting” position.)</p>
<p>After dumplings have cooked for 10 minutes, hit “Cancel” so the bubbles die down.</p>
<p>The chicken should now be relatively should be cool enough to handle. Pick out all the meat, discarding the bones, skin, and cartilage. Rip the chicken by hand into robust pieces and add to the pot. Add in the heavy cream and give everything a final stir until well combined.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Start a small pot of water boiling, to blanch the tomatoes. While you are waiting for the water to boil, chop the onion, garlic and green onions. In a large pan, sauté the onion in the olive oil. When it begins to soften, add the garlic and green onions. Cook until the mixture is softened but not browned. When the water begins to boil, use tongs to add a tomato to the boiling water. Leave it for 30 seconds, more or less, until the skin is loosened. Set the tomato in a bowl to cool. Continue with the remaining tomatoes. Add the flour to the onion mixture. Stir until the flour is mixed in and coated with oil. Continue to cook for approximate 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup of the chicken stock, and stir to create a smooth sauce. Gradually mix in the remaining chicken stock and bring to a simmer over low heat. Remove the skins from the tomatoes. Also remove any stem or core. Chop the tomatoes into 1-inch chunks. Add the tomatoes to the soup. Simmer gently for 15 minutes. Stir in the cream and basil. Heat for about 2 minutes, but do not let the soup boil. Set up the food processor or blender. Using a slotted spoon, add the solids from the soup to the blender. Process briefly, then add the rest of the soup. Blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot. Check the salt; you may not need to add any salt, depending on the saltiness of your chicken stock.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Preheat oven to 300°F. Cut the pumpkin in half through the stem end, and cut out the long stringy fibers. Cut each pumpkin half into 3- to 4-inch pieces. There should be about 8 pieces from each pumpkin. Using a vegetable peeler, pare the rind from the pumpkins, digging the peeler down a little to remove more than just the superficial layer of rind.</p>
<p>Place the pumpkin pieces hollow sides up in a baking pan large enough to hold them in a single layer. Coat both sides of the pieces, using all of the the oil. Pour all the sugar evenly over the pieces. Cover the pan.</p>
<p>Bake the pumpkins until the color turns darker orange and becomes nearly translucent, and the texture is extremely tender, about 3 hours and 15 minutes. Baste the pieces once with the pan juices after 2 ½ hours of baking.</p>
<p>Meat Sauce: Heat the oil in a heavy, medium-sized saucepan until it ripples. Add the onions and sauté over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown, about 18 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the beef and sauté, stirring constantly to break it up into tiny pieces, until the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Stir in the tomato, garlic, coriander, salt, pepper and turmeric. Cook for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Blend in the tomato paste. Add the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Yields 2½ cups sauce, which should be more than enough.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Asakusa Nori, or just Nori, is a kind of seaweed that comes in sheets and is used for sushi rolls. Wasabi is the green Japanese horseradish.  You can buy it in a powder and reconstitute it, but try to get the wasabi that comes in a tube. To accompany this, it is nice to have some picked ginger slices, if you can find them. They normally come in a jar, and I've never seen them except in Asian markets. Pickled ginger used to always be a light pink color, but now all I see is white - I wonder if it used to contain food coloring.</p>
<p>The Japanese use a sudare mat to make sushi rolls.  It is a small flexible bamboo mat that costs about a dollar.  You can use a clean dish towel if you don't have one, but the sudare mat is much easier to use.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Chop the cabbage into large pieces – don’t try to shred it or chop it too fine; ribbons about 3/8” work as well. Everything shrinks down during fermentation.</p>
<p>Make the brine of ¼ cup of salt to 4 cups of water. Place the cabbage, carrots and daikon into a large bowl or glass jar and pour in the brine. Using your fist, press on the vegetables until the liquid level rises to the top of the vegetables. The level may not rise sufficiently at first, but after an hour or so, with a few rounds of pressure on the vegetables, the liquid should cover them.</p>
<p>Weight the vegetables to keep them submerged. The liquid level will rise as the salt and pressure leaches excess liquid from the vegetables. Soak for at least 2 hours or let it sit overnight. Drain the vegetables.</p>
<p>Separately, finely dice the ginger and garlic. Add the hot pepper powder and mix well. Mix the paste into the drained vegetables. Mix in the fish sauce and salted shrimp, if you are using them. Place the mix in your fermentation vessel. Place a weight directly onto the ingredients. Press the liquid from the vegetables until it rises to cover them.  It may take several hours to draw out the natural liquids. The vegetables must remain submerged because the kimchi needs an anaerobic environment for the fermentation to take place. Keeping the vegetables from being exposed to the air also helps to prevent mold.</p>
<p>Cover with a loose fitting lid and wait 3 to14 days, more or less; 7 days is common. Watch out, as kimchi tends to bubble a lot during early fermentation; put a plate underneath the jar to catch overflow. Place in the refrigerator when the kimchi reaches your desired taste, but it will continue to slowly ferment in the refrigerator.</p></TEXT>

title : <TEXT>Kimchi</TEXT>
notes : <TEXT><div id="notes"><p>Keep tasting it after 3 days and watch how the flavors mellow and the brightness/aliveness picks up. If the room in which the fermentation takes place is cool, the fermentation process will be slower, but 3 days to a week is the normal fermentation time. You can ferment this kimchi for 3-5 weeks; it will continue to get more sour over time. Koreans are known to ferment their kimchi in a crock partially buried in the cool ground for several months, so there are many approaches.</p>
<p>The carrots are optional. Cut the daikon and the carrots very thinly, about 1/16” x 3/8”. You can cut them in strips or matchsticks, but you need them to be thin so that they will ferment in the same length of time as the cabbage.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Yes, I make my own kimchi. When I started making sauerkraut, Steve said “why don’t you ever make kimchi for me?” So I did. The biggest problem is that we cannot possibly eat a giant jar of kimchi before it becomes “old.” And while you can use old kimchi in stir-fry, it loses its texture. So I make a small amount, especially compared to Korean households. Kimchi is good for your digestion and homemade is the best. Use a fermentation rig to make your kimchi, but avoid plastic as much as possible - the flavor of kimchi will permeate the plastic and the odor is impossible to remove.</p>
<p>This recipe is modified from the one at fermentationrecipes.com. The site owner is a vegetarian, so his recipe does not include the optional fish sauce or dried shrimp. I don’t use them either, but they make the recipe more authentic. If you are looking for these ingredients, kochukaru is the name of the Korean red pepper powder; it comes in large resealable bags in Asian markets. There are a variety of grinds and spiciness. Korean fermented salted shrimp are called saeujeot, and you can find the jars in the refrigerator case.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Pre-bake pie shell if needed. Let cool completely before continuing.</p>
<p>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
<p>Place the egg whites and create of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer that is fitted with the whisk attachment. Set aside.</p>
<p>Whisk the egg yolks in a medium bowl (not a small bowl). Set aside.</p>
<p>Whisk together the cornstarch, 1½ cups sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Add water, butter, lemon juice and lemon zest. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking gently. Be patient and do not boil the mixture. Alton does not provide any test for doneness here, but many recipes say that the mixture should "coat the back of a spoon."  Remove the pot from the heat.</p>
<p>One whisk-full at a time, add the lemon mixture to the egg yolks and stir until incorporated. Do this until the eggs are warm and the mixture looks more like custard than yolks, then whisk it back into the pot. Over low heat, stir the mixture from 1 minute, then pour into pie crust.</p>
<p>Make the meringue: Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Then add sugar gradually while beating until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes. Top the pie with meringue immediately - the filling should be hot. Be certain to seal in the filling completely, especially at the edge of the crust.</p>
<p>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the meringue is golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack.</p>
<p>DO NOT CUT the pie until it is completely cool - about 6 hours. Premature cutting will break the starch matrix and turn the filling to lemon soup.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Arrange the cooled pastry shells on two large baking sheets (with raised edges).</p>
<p>Lemon Curd: Combine the egg, egg yolks and sugar in a 1½ quart heavy saucepan. Stir in the lemon juice and zest. Cook over medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally,  until the mixture thickens to a hollandaise sauce consistency. Pour into a bowl and cover the surface of the lemon curd with plastic. Refrigerate until chilled (or for up to 3 days).</p>
<p>Adjust rack to lower third of oven.  Preheat oven to 375°F.</p>
<p>Place about ½ teaspoon of lemon curd in each shell, using either a spoon or a pastry bag with a ¼-inch plain tip.</p>
<p>Meringue: In a large mixing bowl, blend the egg whites with the sugar. Place the mixing bowl over a bowl of hot tap water; stir until the mixture is body temperature. Using an electric mixer, preferably with a whisk attachment, whip until the mixture has peaks that are thick and shiny, about 10 to 15 minutes. Attach a ¼ inch open star decorating tip to a pastry bag. Fill bag with meringue and pipe a tall swirl on each tartlet. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes, until the meringue is light golden. Place baking sheet on a wire rack until tartlets are cool. (It is natural for the meringue to deflate slightly during cooling.)</p>

categories : [ "cakesandpies" ]
directions : <TEXT><p>All ingredients (even the eggs) must be at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>Prepare the pan by greasing and then flouring it. If using a loaf pan, grease the pan and line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper; then flour it.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, lightly combine the milk, eggs, and vanilla.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), combine the dry ingredients, including the poppy seeds and lemon zest. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend.</p>
<p>Add the butter and half the egg mixture. Mix on low speed until ingredients are moistened. Increase to high speed (medium on a stand mixer) and beat for 1 minute to aerate and develop the cake’s structure.</p>
<p>Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Gradually add the remaining egg mixture in two batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides.</p>
<p>Scrape batter into the pan and smooth the top with a spatula. The batter will be almost ½ inch from the top of the 4-cup loaf pan. (If your pan is smaller, use any excess batter for cupcakes.)</p>
<p>Bake 55 to 65 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. To get an attractive split down the middle, wait until the cake has baked for 20 minutes and then, with a lightly-greased sharp knife, make a shallow mark down the middle of the cake.</p>
<p>Cover loosely with buttered foil after 30 minutes to prevent over-browning. The cake should not shrink from the sides of the pan while it is in the oven.</p>
<p>Let the cake cook in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Invert onto a greased rack, then re-invert. Cool completely before wrapping tight.</p>
<p>Lemon Syrup: The lemon syrup adds additional flavor and moisture. It also keeps the cake fresh for a few days longer. But I still usually omit it. Shortly before the cake is done, prepare the lemon syrup. In a small pan over medium heat, combine the sugar and lemon juice until sugar dissolves. As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, poke the cake all over with a toothpick or wire tester; brush with ½ of the syrup. When the cake is inverted and removed from the pan, repeat the poking and brush with more of the syrup. Re-invert the cake and brush the sides with the remaining syrup.</p></TEXT>

<p>Another excellent variation is “Double-Vanilla Pound Cake.” Omit the poppy seeds, lemon peel, and lemon syrup. Using a small sharp knife, split a vanilla bean; if you have a Tahitian vanilla bean that is very aromatic, you may only need ½ of the bean. Put the split bean into a small saucepan with the milk and scald it. Cover immediately, and let cool to room temperature. Remove the vanilla bean and scrape the seeds back into the milk. Add the vanilla-infused milk to the eggs and vanilla extract. Proceed as usual.</p>
<p>You can make this cake in a 6-cup fluted tube pan, if you prefer. The recipe is best in a 4-cup loaf pan, but can be made in a 6-cup loaf pan instead.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Well, I finally bought a bread machine a couple of years ago and the Zojirushi is a wonderful device. It can do a ton of stuff besides just bake bread, but this is the main reason that I use it. It turns out a lovely and consistent loaf every time. I think this is technically a 1½-lb. loaf, but it seems larger.</p>
<p>I have tweaked this bread recipe for a couple of years now. It makes a high-rising loaf that will make sandwiches or toast. The bread has great flavor as well. Because this recipe has eggs and dairy, you cannot use any time delay features. You can vary the ratio of the flours; this ratio gives a light loaf that Steve will occasionally actually eat. I prefer to use King Arthur Flour’s Irish-style whole wheat flour as it makes a delicious bread. If I don’t have that, a sprouted whole-wheat flour also works well. But any good whole wheat flour will do. For the white flour, bread flour is best, but again, all-purpose flour will work too. Just avoid cake flour or pastry flour.</p></TEXT>

The original recipe was definitely for restaurant use; I think it yielded about a gallon or two of marinade - I cut the portions down to something more reasonable, but a quart is still a lot of marinade. I used to put some chicken breasts and this marinade in a plastic freezer bag, and stick it in the ice chest for camping trips. After a day or two, we would grill the chicken over the campfire. I don't know if it was the marinade or the camping, but the chicken was always great.</p></TEXT>

<p>Whisk the egg and vanilla together in a small bowl. With the food processor running, pour the egg mixture down the feed tube. Process until the ingredients form a ball. Remove the dough to a work surface.</p>
<p>Using the heel of your hand, press dough together until it is smooth and cohesive.</p>
<p>Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350°F.</p>
<p>Arrange 4 dozen tartlet tins close together on 12x15 baking sheets with a rim. Pinch off 1 teaspoon of dough at a time and drop it into a tin. Drop a piece of dough into every tin. Then take each tin and remove the dough - roll it into a ball in the palm of your hands.  (This helps shape the dough more evenly.) Drop the ball into the tin, and press the center of the dough into the bottom of the tin with your index finger. Then press dough up on the sides of the tin, while rotating the tin. The goal is to use just enough dough to line the tin, without creating a thick shell. If you have help, set this up as an assembly line.</p>
<p>Bake tartlet shells for 12 to 15 minutes, or until light golden. Remove from baking sheet (but leave in tins) to cool. When the tins are cool enough to touch, squeeze each tin lightly between your thumb and forefinger. Turn the tin upside down and let the shell drop into the palm of your other hand. Repeat until all dough is cooked.</p>
<p>Stack cool, unfilled shells in an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to a week. You can also refrigerate the uncooked dough (well wrapped) for up to a week, or freeze it for up to a month. Bring dough to room temperature before working with it.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I started making miniature desserts for Wolf and Cheryl's annual Thanksgiving dinner.  When you have a dozen different desserts, you can't try them all - unless they are miniatures! They tasted great, and everyone loved the fact that they could just have a taste.</p>
<p>This pastry is more like a cookie dough, which is perfect for miniatures. With a high proportion of dough to filling, the dough should offer some flavor, too. To make these, you will need to invest in some miniature tartlet tins. Flo Baker recommends the 1.5-inch fluted tin, and that has worked well for me. You might have to go to a cooking supply store to get these, but it's worth it.  If you don't want to spend all night cooking the shells, then get at least 2 dozen tins. Flo Baker recommends 4 dozen!  Also, plan to make the pastry a few days (or a week) before you need it; it will be easier on you.</p>
<p>My favorite filling for this is the Lemon Meringue Tartlet recipe. I have also filled these shells with Nutella (a big hit), and canned cherry pie filling.  But you can fill these with almost anything sweet!</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Prepare the oranges: Cut 8 strips of peel, each about 2 inches long by ½ inch wide. Zest orange until you have 1½ teaspoon of fine zest. Juice the oranges to obtain ¾ cup orange juice. You may need only 2 of the oranges, depending on their size.</p>
<p>Marinade: Combine all marinade ingredients - except orange peel strips - in a large saucepan until sugar is fully dissolved. Transfer ¾ cup of the mixture to a medium bowl and add the chicken. Let marinate for at least 10 minutes, or up to an hour.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and water. Bring the mixture in the saucepan to simmer over high heat. Whisk the cornstarch slurry into the sauce, then bring it to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and translucent, about 1 minute. Off the heat, stir in the orange peel strips and the dried peppers. The sauce should measure about 1½ cups.</p>
<p>For the coating: Using a fork, lightly beat the egg whites in a shallow dish until frothy. In a second shallow dish, whisk cornstarch, baking soda and cayenne until mixed. Drain the chicken and pat dry with paper towels. In batches, coat the chicken with the egg mixture; then transfer to the cornstarch mixture and dredge gently. Gently shake off excess and place chicken pieces on a wire rack to dry slightly. Repeat with remaining chicken.</p>
<p>Fry the chicken: Heat 3 cups oil in a Dutch oven over high heat until the oil registers 350°F. Carefully place half the chicken in the oil and fry until golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Turn each piece with tongs, about halfway through. Transfer the cooked chicken to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.</p>
<p>To serve, reheat the sauce over medium heat until simmering, about 2 minutes. Add the fried chicken and gently toss to coat. Serve when heated through.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I have eaten a lot of terrible, gloppy messes called Pasta Primavera - it seems to be a restaurant standard for punishing vegetarians. This recipe is different; the flavors are fresh and there is no sauce. I always add a generous amount of freshly grated Parmesan cheese before serving.  Fresh mint is great, but if you can't find it (it grows here year round),  you could use fresh basil instead. I'd put this recipe in the category of Favorites, but I don't think it rates that high with Steve; he hates mint.</p></TEXT>

<p>Once the dough begins to come together, scrape out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until soft and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Place dough in a clean mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise, about 2 hours, until doubled.</p>
<p>Divide dough into two parts. Lightly oil each piece and place it in a plastic bag. Place the bags in the refrigerator (or freeze). Use refrigerated dough within 3 days.</p>
<p>On the day you want to cook, remove the dough from the refrigerator at least an hour before cooking. For frozen dough, move it from the freezer to the refrigerator the night before.</p>
<p>If you are using a pizza stone, position it in the oven. Preheat oven to 450°F(or higher) for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Working on a floured surface, press and stretch each dough ball to form a round. Work from the center to the edge. Use a rolling pin if necessary. If the dough is very elastic, allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then try again.</p>
<p>I cut circles of parchment paper for making pizza. The circles give me a target size for shaping the dough, but they also make it simple to move the pizzas around. After placing the pizza in the oven, wait about 3-5 minutes, then jerk the paper from beneath the pizza. You may be able to reuse the paper for a second pizza. (I usually make 2 to 10 pizzas in a session, with each person topping their own pizza.)</p>
<p>When dough is shaped, add toppings, leaving a 1-inch border around the edge.</p>
<p>Bake until edges are golden and cheese is bubbling, 10-15 minutes. The bottom of the crust should be crisp and brown, with occasional darker patches.</p>

time : <TEXT></TEXT>
introduction : <TEXT><p>Over the years, I’ve made a lot of home-made pizza. I’ve tried all kinds of flour and techniques. While there is no single answer, this is my preference for home-made pizza. I use 100% Italian Tipo “00” flour - you can find it in a lot of grocery stores these days. My preferred brand is DeLallo Organic; DeLallo also makes a nice pizza sauce. I don’t use any oil in the dough. Keeping the dough in the refrigerator overnight really develops its character, but if you must use it on the same day, you can. Just skip the refrigeration step.</p>
<p>Another thing that will improve home-made pizza is more heat. Usually that comes from a pizza stone. I have two: one is a traditional stone; the other is a slab of stainless steel that I bought from a company called “Baking Steel.” The steel weighs a ton, but it works great. Finally, I broke down and bought a Breville Crispy Crust Pizza Maker, and it is awesome too.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, preheat the oven and the stone a lot. That means at least a half hour of preheating for a regular oven.</p>
<p>You may also want to experiment with setting the heat even higher; wood-fired pizza ovens typically cook at 800°F. I set the countertop Breville to its maximum of 660°F.</p>
<p>Finally, Italians don’t overload their pizzas and neither should you. Use a few high quality ingredients and let the taste of the crust come through. Piling on the toppings will slow the cooking and prevent the crust from becoming crisp. The toppings should all be warm or room-temperature when you put them on the pizza.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Stir together flour, salt and yeast in a 4-quart bowl.  With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until all of the flour is absorbed.  (Or mix on low speed of stand mixer.)</p>
<p>Now, if you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip your hand or the metal spoon into cold water and use it like a dough hook to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass.  Rotate the bowl while you do this.  Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or as long as it takes to develop smooth sticky dough.</p>
<p>If you are using a mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix on medium until you get a smooth sticky dough.  The dough should clear the sides of the bowl, but stick to the bottom.  The finished dough will be springy, elastic and sticky - not just tacky - with a temperature of 50° - 55°F.</p>
<p>Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with parchment and then lightly oiling (or spraying) the parchment.  Sprinkle flour on the counter and turn out the dough.  Separate the dough into 6 equal parts.  Sprinkle flour over the dough and flour your dry hands.  Lift each piece of dough and gently round it into a ball.  Place the dough balls on the sheet pan.  Spray the dough generously with oil and slip the pan into a food-grade plastic bag. Refrigerate for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>On the day that you plan to make the pizza, remove the dough 2 hours before you plan to cook it.  Dust the counter will flour, and mist with spray oil.  Place the dough balls on the counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour..  Press each ball into a disk about 5" across and 1/2" thick.  Cover the dough loosely with plastic.  Let rest for 2 hours.</p>
<p>At least 45 minutes before making, place a baking stone on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven as high as it will go, about 550°F.</p>
<p>Shape the dough. If it refuses to stretch, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes. Each 6-oz piece of dough should stretch to 9 to 12 inches in diameter. Top the pizza and then slide into the oven. After 2 minutes, check the pizza and rotate it 180 degrees for even baking. It should be done in 3-6 minutes longer. Wait 3-5 minutes before slicing.</p>

Place the dough balls on the counter and sprinkle them with flour; dust your hands with flour..  Press each ball into a disk about 5" across and 1/2" thick.  Cover the dough loosely with plastic.  Let rest for 2 hours.</p>
<p>At least 45 minutes before making, place a baking stone on a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven as high as it will go, about 550°F.</p>
<p>Shape the dough. If it refuses to stretch, let it rest for 5 to 20 minutes. Each 6-oz piece of dough should stretch to 9 to 12 inches in diameter. Top the pizza and then slide into the oven.</p>
<p>After 2 minutes, check the pizza and rotate it 180 degrees for even baking. It should be done in 3-6 minutes longer. Wait 3-5 minutes before slicing.</p></TEXT>

I am the only person at my house who ever really liked this, but I still like it and I occasionally still make it. It's a pretty easy recipe if you use a food processor for all the grating. I have other Potato Kugel recipes; apparently it was a vegetarian favorite in the 1970's. All the recipes are similar, but some call for up to ¾ cup of liquid to be added to the potatoes.  I do tend to add a little liquid, because the recipe seems pretty dry otherwise.  Some even call for baking powder in an attempt to obtain a more fluffy texture.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>After I started baking bread, I realized that I liked rye bread - I just didn't like caraway seeds and some of the other stuff that people often put in rye bread. This bread doesn't have anything that I don't like. Rye bread is heavy, so don't expect light and airy loaves. This particular recipe should be about like whole wheat bread or maybe a little lighter, since it is half white flour.</p>
<p>If you only use rye flour occasionally, you need to store it in the refrigerator. Otherwise, the natural oils in the rye flour will spoil and give it an off taste. At this point, I buy only enough rye flour for whatever I am making, and throw away any leftover. This only works if you can buy exactly the amount you need; try a health-food store that sells staples in bulk. Smell the flour before you buy it; if it doesn't have any odor, that's okay. If it has become rancid, you will be able to tell.</p></TEXT>

<p>This recipe calls for optional caramel coloring. If you use it, the bread will look darker, but will be otherwise the same. If you don’t have caramel coloring, you could use 2 tablespoons of cocoa, carob, or coffee powder, mixed with 1 tablespoon of water.</p>
<p>Variation: Marbled Rye Bread - this combines a light dough with a dark dough in a spiral or other shape. It looks cool, but it tastes the same. Marbled Rye is a popular style of bread in New York delis. To prepare it: make 1 recipe of dough without the caramel coloring, and one recipe using the caramel coloring. When dividing and sharing the dough, separate each recipe into 4 pieces instead of 2. For each loaf, take one piece of white dough and one piece of dark dough. Roll the pieces together in spirals, torpedos, or however you wish. You will end up with 4 loaves of bread, since you have made 2 recipes of dough.</p>

I didn't make these often when the kids were growing up, because 12 cookies would have lasted for about 2 minutes.  By the way, they are fine without any nuts or herbs.</p></TEXT>

categories : [ "basics" ]
directions : <TEXT><p>Make sure that all the jars, bowls and your hands are very clean before you begin. You don’t want to ferment anything nasty.</p>
<p>Measure the salt into a small bowl or cup.</p>
<p>Start by removing the outer leaves from the cabbage if they are looking a little sketchy. it they look fine, you can leave them and rinse them off to remove potential contaminants. Cut the cabbage into ½” wide ribbons. I cut the cabbage in half or quarters first, depending on its size. Then I cut out the core and start slicing. You can make the ribbons into any size you like, but I find that thinner pieces don’t retain as much crunch as I like. Place the cabbage in a large bowl as you slice it, preferably made of glass. I like to sprinkle the salt over the cabbage as I go, or you can mix it in all at once.</p>
<p>After all the cabbage is sliced, toss the cabbage and the salt to mix well. I use my hands and give the cabbage a squeeze as I toss. If it feels wet, that is good. Let the cabbage sweat in the bowl for about an hour.</p>
<p>Mix in the berries and seeds if you are using them. Place everything, including any accumulated liquid, into your fermenting vessel. I use a large-mouth Mason jar that is large enough to hold it all - either a quart or half-gallon size. I squeeze the cabbage again as I add it to the jar.</p>
<p>Once you have the cabbage in the jar, press it very hard. You can use your fist, a wooden spoon or an implement made for the purpose (called a pickle press). Keep pressing until you get tired.</p>
<p>Place something with some weight to it on top of the cabbage to keep pressing while you rest.</p>
<p>Keep pressing and resting as needed, over the next hour or two. Your goal is to have the liquid rise to cover the cabbage completely. Be sure to release any air pockets that might develop.</p>
<p>If after several hours, you can’t get the liquid high enough, you can add just enough water to cover by 1 inch. Use filtered, unchlorinated water (distilled water is good). Add about ½ teaspoon of salt to each cup of water to keep the salt balance.</p>
<p>Place a weight on the cabbage to keep it from floating to the surface. Anything that floats may be exposed to air and spoil instead of ferment.</p>
<p>Cover with a fermentation tap or other device that will allow air to escape, but that does not allow air in.</p>
<p>Feel free to taste every day and decide when the sauerkraut seems best to you. Place it in the refrigerator at that point to stop the fermentation. Usually the sauerkraut is ready in 7 to 14 days, depending on your taste, room temperature and other factors. Some people believe it will have the greatest health benefits if you wait 6 to 8 weeks! I find that 10 to 14 days usually matches both my taste buds and my patience.</p>
<p>If some pieces of sauerkraut float to the top during the fermentation process, just discard them. Of course, that doesn’t matter after you refrigerate it.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I usually halve this recipe unless I plan to give away at least half of the product. I like sauerkraut. It’s a great probiotic and low calorie; it’s good for you. But I just can’t eat that much sauerkraut alone.</p>
<p>Also know that I will never use the optional ingredients: I hate caraway and I think juniper berries should be reserved for their proper use in gin.</p>
<p>Finally, you must have a fermentation rig of some sort to make sauerkraut, kimchi and other types of pickles. Masontops Pickle Pipes are great silicon airlocks that work with standard Mason jars, but there are lots of options. Jessica and I have spares if you would like to try them. (And ask her about the fresh sour pickles that she makes with David.)</p>
<p>Your goal is to provide an anaerobic environment for the sauerkraut to ferment and develop.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>You can tell that this recipe attempts to "balance the proteins" because of the powdered milk. Skip it if you want. Even if you are a strict vegetarian, research has shown that you don't need to balance the proteins in every meal, just across your diet as a whole. And while I'm on the subject, there is not very much nutritional difference between "converted rice" and brown rice. That's why we eat a lot of converted rice at our house.</p>
<p>This tastes better than you might imagine, depending on how adventuresome you are. The cookbook says "good for a picnic," and I'd agree with that, especially for vegetarians.  They are fine at room temperature, and can be eaten from your hand.</p></TEXT>

You can eat strawberries with angel food cake or pound cake or whatever, but it just isn't the same. Arkansas produces a lot of strawberries, so it was common to have a shortcake sometime during the late spring. I’ll skip the whipped cream; instead, I want the shortcake warm and well-buttered, and the strawberries cold and juicy. I'll just put a few more berries and some juice on top, thank you.</p></TEXT>

I do find that these make a relatively heavy bun. If you don't like this, slice the bun into 3 pieces horizontally (instead of just slicing it in two). Use the middle disc to make it a "double burger," or save them to make round sandwiches with later.</p>

notes : <TEXT><div id="notes"><p>Other notes from Sean:</p>
<p>I don't use off-the-shelf pumpkin pie spice unless I happen to have it in the cabinet, and I usually don't. I prefer about equal portions of cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg, and ground allspice. I like a lot of spice. I tend to add more spice mix until I can smell it over the butter and the yams in the mix. It takes more than you think to get it to that level, and not everyone likes it that way.</p>
<p>You can remove the topping altogether and use marshmallows. If you do, serve immediately. Do not put the marshmallows on, slap a lid on it, and then drive an hour to your Mother's house. When you get there, you will have a clear simple syrup on top of your casserole. It's still yummy, but it looks a little gross. Put the marshmallows on when you get there and bake it until toasted.</p>
<p>All of the topping measures are approximate because it will vary greatly depending on the shape of the dish you use. Alter the recipe to fit your dish. If you aren’t sure what to do instead of pumpkin pie spice, I recommend that you start with ½ tsp. ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp. ground ginger, and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. Add ¼ tsp. ground allspice and ¼ tsp. ground cloves if you have them, otherwise increase the other spices a bit.</p>

Cognitive dissonance is required." He's right, so get over it already. Sean uses a Pyrex bread dish, but you could use an 8x8 glass casserole dish if you prefer. You can also substitute other tree nuts for the pecans, although that doesn't make any sense to us Southerners. Bake the yams a day ahead to shorten the preparation time.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Whisk together the dry ingredients. Stir in enough heavy cream to moisten the dough thoroughly. You may need to use only 1 cup in a humid environment, and maybe even a tiny bit more than 1¼ cup if you are in a very dry climate. You want to be able to gather the dough together and squeeze it; it should hang together easily, without dry bits falling off.</p>
<p>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface, and very gently pat it into an 8-inch circle about ¾-inch thick. Use a sharp 2¼" cutter to cut rounds - or do what I do: cut the dough into squares (or even wedges) with a very sharp knife. Place the dough on a lightly greased (or parchment lined) baking sheet. Brush the biscuits with the butter, if desired.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I have a reputation for making tough biscuits and pie crusts. This recipe changed that. These biscuits are very tender; the cornstarch taste comes through as a subtle flavor that reminds me of commercial baked goods. Hmm, I wonder why! If you don't want to use cornstarch, try potato flour instead. You can add a little more sugar or a little less, to taste. I never bother with the melted butter.</p>
<p>These are amazingly easy to make, but they need to sit before cooking. So start the biscuits first, and then make the rest of the meal.  This recipe does not make good biscuits for topping other dishes or for dumplings - they will tend to fall apart.</p></TEXT>

When I started cooking, this got dropped from my rotation pretty quickly because I was just tired of it. Mother made it with 2 tablespoons of dried bell pepper flakes and 1 tablespoon of dried onion flakes. She also used dried beef bullion cubes. I don't usually have those ingredients, so I've given the fresh ingredients instead. I think  it is much more an Arkansas dish than a Texas one.</p></TEXT>

It has a lemony flavor - but don't eat it!  Like a cinnamon stick, it is there just to provide flavor; I usually cut it in 1-inch lengths, so it is easy to find and remove from the soup. You can also cook the lemongrass in the stock for about 10 minutes and then remove it, then cook the soup as directed.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>I am a huge fan of Thai soups, but sometimes they are too spicy for me; this soup is not. If you are sensitive to hot peppers, you can slice the jalapeños so that you can avoid them, but they do add an important flavor. This is a fairly heavy version of the soup. If you prefer it lighter, use half as much coconut milk and twice as much stock.</p></TEXT>

id : <TEXT>ThanksgivingTurkey</TEXT>
categories : [ "thanksgiving", "favorites", "chicken" ]
directions : <TEXT><p>Let the thawed turkey stand, in its wrapping, for at least 1 hour to "warm up." It will cook more evenly if it is near room temperature before you begin cooking. However, once the turkey has reached room temperature, it should be cooked immediately. (I start cooking the turkey while it is still chilly.)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325°F.</p>
<p>Remove giblets.  Wash the turkey with cold water. Pat it dry inside and out. Stuff turkey if desired. If you choose to bake your stuffing separately, place the chopped onion, celery, garlic and herbs inside the cavity.  Close the cavity; I use cheap turkey trussing pins and twine (you can find these in the grocery store around the holidays).</p>
<p>Make a paste of the oil, salt and paprika. Rub this mixture all over the outside of the bird, using your hands. It''s messy. You will have plenty of paste. Place the bird in an open pan or on a roasting rack, breast side up. Cover the ends of the drumsticks and wings with aluminum foil to prevent them from over-browning. Pour the water into the bottom of the pan and place in the oven.</p>
<p>Roast until the bird is half-done. Heat the wine (do not boil it) and pour over the turkey. Wrap the turkey breast tightly with foil for the last hour of cooking. See the chart for estimated times.</p>
<p>The turkey is done when: (1) the internal temperature of the bird, in the thickest part of the thigh, is 175°F;  (2) the juices of the thigh run clear when pierced with a knife; (3) the thigh moves easily in the joint. The only sure technique is the thermometer.  If you don''t have one, get a meat thermometer - it''s cheaper than the price of a turkey.</p>
<p>Also, check the temperature of the stuffing.  It should be at least 160°F.  If the turkey is done, but the stuffing is not, take the turkey out and remove the stuffing to a buttered baking dish.  Put the stuffing back in the oven while the turkey rests.</p>
<p>Let the turkey stand for 15 minutes before carving; the temperature of the thigh should rise to 180°F.  Even if the turkey is late, let it stand and be a little later.  Otherwise, it will be dry.</p>
<p>Estimated cooking times:</p>
<p>14-16 lb.  --  3 ½ to 3 ¾ hours</p>
<p>16-18 lb.  --  3 ¾ to 4 hours</p>
<p>18-20 lb.  --  4 to 4 ½ hours</p>
<p>20-22 lbs --  4 ½ to 5 hours</p>
<p>22-24 lbs -- 5 to 5 ½ hours</p>
<p>The cooking time can vary even more than 30 minutes based on individual oven differences and the temperature of the turkey when you began cooking it.</p></TEXT>

title : <TEXT>Thanksgiving Turkey</TEXT>
notes : <TEXT><div id="notes"><p>A lot of "fresh, never frozen" turkeys have hard, icy giblets, because they are chilled to 26°F. Get a fresh bird at least 24 hours before you intend to cook it, so you will have plenty of time to thaw it properly. Turkeys are not considered frozen until they reach 24°F, and are frozen solid. Thawing a  truly frozen bird in the refrigerator will take about 24 hours for every 5 pounds, so a 20 pound frozen turkey will take 4 days.  If you thaw a frozen bird in cold water, changing the water frequently, it will only take 30 minutes per pound (still, that would be about 10 hours for the 20 lb. frozen bird).</p>
<p>As you are planning your holiday meal and deciding when to start the turkey, give yourself about 30 minutes to wrestle with stuffing the turkey and getting it in the oven. It's never as quick and easy as I think it's going to be.</p>
<p>You should plan for about 1½ pounds of turkey per person; this will give you plenty of left-overs, unless you buy a really small bird.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>Since I only cook turkey once or twice a year, I am hardly an expert. However, I have had consistently good results with this recipe. By the way, you can baste the turkey if you want, but it doesn't help it cook and it doesn't make the meat more moist. Some people think that salting the outside of the bird will dry it out; you can leave the salt out of this recipe if you like. I'm not sure it makes any difference.In my experience, the most important factor is that the turkey is completely thawed. A properly thawed turkey will cook more evenly and will not dry out as much before it is done. It will also get done close to the time you expect, not 2 hours later!</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>For more than 30 years, I was happy with my simple brownie recipe. Then I had these brownies - fudge-y and cake-y at the same time, dark and sweet - they were the best brownies I had ever eaten. You can leave out the espresso powder, but it does add something. And you can leave out the chocolate chips, but again you will lose some richness and flavor. I hear that these brownies are fine made with regular cocoa, but I love the double-Dutch dark cocoa that you can get from King Arthur Flour.</p>

directions : <TEXT><p>Remove steak from refrigerator. Pat dry and place on a rack for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes. Lightly oil meat - as lightly as possible on both sides. Pat with paper towels to remove excess oil if necessary. Generously salt and pepper both sides on meat. Really rub the salt into the meat. Let meat rest on the rack for 5 minutes or more. It is best for the steak to come to room temperature for greatest control of the cooking.</p>
<p>Place a cast iron skillet over the highest heat for 3 minutes. Turn on exhaust vent (or open windows). Carefully lower a steak into the pan -- once it touches the pan, DO NOT SLIDE IT OR MOVE IT. (So if you are planning to cook a second steak in the same pan at the same time, be very careful about your placement.) Do NOT touch the meat for 2 ½ minutes.  Leave the heat on high. Carefully turn steak over and cook the second side for 2 minutes. Move the meat to a clean rack. Cover loosely with foil or an inverted bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.  (Not even for the last steak. How would you like to have to wait for the last steak and then find that yours was tougher and drier than everyone else''s? That would be doubly bad.)</p>
<p>The time given is for a rib-eye, about ½ to ¾ inch thick, cooked to medium. If your stove is hotter than mine, the meat thicker, or you like your meat more rare, then you will need to adjust your time appropriately.  Whatever you do - don''t be afraid to push the limits a little bit and DON''T MOVE THE MEAT. Pick a time and live with it.  Adjust future steaks based on experience.</p>
<p>Steve’s alternative: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Using the above technique, sear the steak on each side until browned, then place in oven for about 5 minutes. If you want to remove the steak from the skillet into the oven, then make sure you have a preheated pan in the oven for the steak.</p></TEXT>

introduction : <TEXT><p>It doesn't really matter what the weight of the steak is, or what kind of steak it is. I think this is a great way to cook rib-eye. The key concern is the size (it needs to fit in a pan) and the thickness (which affects cooking time). This truly is the greatest steak I've ever cooked, thanks to Alton Brown. The first time I cooked this, I even overcooked the steak a little (it was no longer pink in the middle) - and it was still better than any steak I'd ever had in a restaurant or just about anywhere. Unbelievable, and so easy.</p>
<p>You can make as many steaks as you like, but you are obviously limited by the number of appropriate pans and stove burners.  It is possible to cook 2 steaks in the same pan at the same time - if the steaks are small and you are very careful. It is also best to do multiple steaks on a gas range, as it gets much hotter than an electric range. Electric just doesn't put out enough heat to sear more than one steak at a time very effectively.</p>
<p>Be aware that this technique will create smoke in your kitchen, especially for steaks with more fat. Open windows, use a fan, turn off the smoke detectors.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>Sauté onions and garlic in the 3 tablespoons of olive oil until soft and transparent. Add mushrooms and sauté until they begin to release their liquid. Stir in tomato sauce, oregano, basil, parsley and salt. Cook the sauce about 30 minutes, simmering and stirring often until it has thickened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water. Rinse cooked noodles in cold water and set aside.</p>
<p>When sauce has finished simmering, stir in the adzuki beans. Heat briefly.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Layer noodles in a shallow casserole, then spread with 1/3 of the tomato sauce. Top with 1/3 of the ricotta, then 1/3 of the mozzarella, 1/3 of the asiago fresca and 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers twice more. Bake for 20 minutes; lasagna should be bubbly, but not dried-out.</p></TEXT>

directions : <TEXT><p>All the water in this recipe should be between 120 and 130°F - as hot as it comes out of the faucet, more or less.</p>
<p>Mix flours, yeast, and salt in a medium bowl. Add oil and then all of the water. Stir until the bowl is clean and all the flour has been picked up. Fill a large bowl with hot water. Drop the dough into the bowl of hot water. The dough will sink, but will float in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes, remove dough immediately to a work surface that has been dusted with ¼ flour; sprinkle remaining ¼ cup flour on top.  (Dry your hands now.)</p>
<p>Knead gently for about 5 minutes, adding more flour only if needed to keep dough from sticking. Divide dough in thirds. Knead each piece for 1 minute, then roll out and shape into a 12-inch long loaf. Place on greased cookie sheet or in French bread pans, if you have them. Leave as much room as possible between loaves. (You can even use a baking stone.)</p>
<p>Place dough in cold oven and spray with a fine mist of water. Turn oven on its lowest setting for exactly 1 minute, then turn off. Let dough rest in the oven for 15 minutes, then remove dough.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F for 10 minutes. Place dough (which should have doubled) in the oven and mist again with water. After 15 minutes, open the oven and mist the dough yet again. Bread should be done in 5 to 9 minutes more. Cool on racks for 10 minutes before cutting.</p>

directions : <TEXT><p>The day before, make the soaker and the poolish. For the soaker: Mix the soaker ingredients in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature until the next day. For the poolish: Mix together the flour and yeast, then stir in the water to make a thick paste. Stir only until the flour is hydrated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let ferment for 2 to 4 hours, or until it just begins to bubble. Then place it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p>To complete the bread: One hour before you begin, remove the poolish from the refrigerator. In a mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt and yeast. Then add the poolish and the soaker, as well as the honey, oil and egg. Stir with a large metal spoon (or mix on low speed for about 1 minute with the paddle attachment) until the dough forms a ball. Add more water or flour if needed. Transfer dough to a floured work surface. Knead until the dough forms a firm, supple dough. This will take 10 to 15 minutes by hand, slightly less by machine. The dough will be tacky, not sticky.  It should pass the windowpane test. Lightly oil a large bowl. Add the dough and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until double, about 2 hours.</p>
<p>Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Shape into loaves. Mist the tops with oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for about 90 minutes, or until the dough nearly doubles in size and is cresting over the lip of the pans.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Bake the loaves for 30 minutes, then rotate for even baking. Continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes longer. The finished bread should register between 185 and 190°F.  It should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. If the loaves are soft and squishy on the sides, return them to the pans and continue baking until done.

categories : [ "desserts" ]
directions : <TEXT><p>Crust: Grease and flour a 9-inch (or 10-inch) spring form pan. Separate the bottom and the sides of the pan. Preheat the oven to 400°F.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg yolk, lemon peel and vanilla. Add flour and combine well, but beat slowly and only until well-mixed. With well-floured hands, press 1/3 of the dough onto the bottom of the pan. Place the dough in the center and use the palm of your hand to push it to the edges of the pan bottom. Bake the bottom crust for 8 to 10 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned. Let the bottom crust cool, then attach the sides of the pan to the bottom. With well-floured hands, spread the remaining dough over the sides of the pan. Carefully join the dough to the crust at the bottom of the pan. If this is all you accomplish for the day, put the crust in the refrigerator until you complete the filling.</p>
<p>Filling: Preheat oven to 500°F. Slice cream cheese into a large bowl. With a hand mixer, combine cream cheese, sugar, flour, orange rind, lemon peel and vanilla. Beat until smooth and well blended. (The rinds tend to clump around the beaters.) Add eggs and egg yolks, one at a time; blend into the mixture. Mix in the heavy cream. Pour the mixture into the prepared crust. Place a piece of aluminum foil under the pan, in case the pan leaks. Bake at 500°Ffor 8 minutes. Reduce heat and bake at 250°Ffor 70 minutes.</p>
<p>Since it is often difficult to determine when the cheesecake is done, test it with a toothpick in the center - when the toothpick comes out clean (mixture-free), the cheesecake is usually done. Cool the cheesecake in the pan. After a couple of hours, you can put it in the refrigerator. When cool, invert the pan on a large plate covered with parchment paper. Remove the pan carefully, especially the bottom. Use a spatula if necessary to detach the crust from the pan. Invert the cheesecake (to put it back right-side up) on a serving dish or plate.</p>
<p>Topping: Rinse and drain the raspberries and blueberries. Crush enough of the "defective" berries to make 1 cup. Combine the crushed berries, sugar, water, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan. Cook the mixture, stirring most of the time with a wooden spoon, until it is clear and thick. Cook 2 minutes more; the mixture will begin to boil. Remove from heat; add butter. Strain the mixture through a sieve and allow to cool. Artfully arrange the remaining berries on the cheesecake. Cover the cheesecake, top and sides, with the cooled glaze.</p>
<p>Chill the cheesecake in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, though longer is better. (It seems the best one day after cutting out the first 1 or 2 pieces.)</p>
<p>Cooking notes from past experience:</p>
<p>- if the bottom crust is thin, you may need to stop cooking at 8 minutes instead of 9.</p>
<p>- the filling did not rise to the last inch of my 10-inch pan, so the last inch of side crust was over-browned.  The crust was spread too thin overall, because my pan is a bit tall for the recipe.</p>
<p>- I baked it for an extra 20 minutes, but it still failed the toothpick test.  And yet, it seemed overdone.</p></TEXT>

notes : <TEXT><div id="notes"><p>You can use frozen or fresh berries for the topping. If you use frozen, thaw and drain them; add any drained juice to the glaze.</p>
<p>I have learned that you can't trust the toothpick test when a large cheesecake is still in the oven. Carry-over will continue to cook it for quite some time,
so you need to remove it from the oven while it is still a little soft in the middle, especially if the outside few inches are done.</p>

introduction : <TEXT><p>This is Wolfgang's famous cheesecake, and rightly so. You can top it with whatever you like, but I have entered only the raspberry/blueberry topping, because I like it the best. Wolfgang does not advise pineapple topping.</p>
<p>This is a huge cheesecake, very rich. You should not eat more than a very small slice at one sitting. I'd guess that it could easily serve 2 dozen people.</p></TEXT>
