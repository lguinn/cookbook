                <h2>Introduction to the Second Edition</h2>
                <p>In this edition, I have corrected all the errors that I found in 10 years of cooking 
                    from this book. I hope I found them all. I eliminated a few of the recipes that were
                     in the first edition, because they just werenâ€™t good enough. However, I kept all the 
                     traditional family recipes that I have, whether I personally liked them or not.</p>
                <p>There are over 50 new favorites in this collection. Many of the new recipes came from you, 
                    my family, and friends. Thank you all.</p>
                <p>I have also added a bit more general information to the beginning of each section. Since 
                    this is the cookbook that is always on my countertop, the first edition accumulated a 
                    lot of handwritten notes about cooking temperatures and other trivia. I decided that 
                    I might as well include these notes in the new book.</p>
